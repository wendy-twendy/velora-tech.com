## Migration Overview

The Velora Tech website is being migrated from JavaScript to TypeScript to improve code quality, maintainability, and developer experience. The website will continue to be deployed on GitHub Pages.

Key features to preserve during migration:
- Bilingual support (English and Albanian)
- Automatic language detection based on user location
- Manual language switching capability
- All existing functionality and UI components

## Project Setup

- [x] Initialize npm project (`npm init -y`)
- [x] Install TypeScript and related dependencies
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader webpack webpack-cli
  ```
- [x] Create TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json)
- [x] Create Webpack configuration file (webpack.config.js)
- [x] Update package.json with build scripts
- [x] Set up project structure with src directory
- [x] Update index.html to reference the bundled JavaScript file
- [x] Configure GitHub Pages deployment

### TypeScript Configuration (tsconfig.json)

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": false,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "paths": {
      "*": ["node_modules/*", "src/types/*"]
    },
    "lib": ["DOM", "DOM.Iterable", "ESNext"],
    "jsx": "react",
    "allowJs": true,
    "checkJs": false,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```

### Webpack Configuration (webpack.config.js)

```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  mode: 'production',
  entry: './src/js/app.ts',
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.tsx?$/,
        use: 'ts-loader',
        exclude: /node_modules/,
      },
    ],
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.tsx', '.ts', '.js'],
  },
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
};
```

## Type Definitions to Create

- [x] Create `src/types/index.ts` for global type definitions
- [x] Create language interface definitions
- [x] Create component interface definitions
- [x] Create DOM element type definitions

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify all JavaScript functionality works after TypeScript conversion
- [ ] Test language detection and switching
- [ ] Verify all animations and interactive elements
- [ ] Test responsive design on multiple screen sizes
- [ ] Test contact form functionality
- [ ] Verify project filters work correctly
- [ ] Test testimonial slider
- [ ] Verify correct loading of all components

## Deployment Notes

### GitHub Pages Configuration

- [x] Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds
- [x] Configure deployment to gh-pages branch
- [x] Add .nojekyll file to prevent Jekyll processing

### Build and Deploy Process

1. Run TypeScript compiler and webpack build
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Commit and push changes to GitHub
3. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy to GitHub Pages

## Migration Steps in Detail

1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize npm and install dependencies
   - Create configuration files
   - Set up project structure

2. **File Conversion Process**
   - Create type definitions
   - Convert utility functions first
   - Convert modules with fewer dependencies
   - Convert main application files
   - Update HTML files to reference compiled JavaScript

3. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Test each module after conversion
   - Address type errors and compatibility issues
   - Verify full functionality

4. **Deployment**
   - Update GitHub workflow if needed
   - Configure GitHub Pages settings
   - Deploy and verify live site

## Next Steps

1. **Test the TypeScript Implementation**
   - Test all features to ensure they work correctly with the TypeScript implementation
   - Test bilingual functionality thoroughly
   - Verify responsive design on multiple devices

2. **Deploy and Monitor**
   - Deploy the TypeScript version
   - Monitor for any issues after deployment

## Decision on app.ts and main.ts

After reviewing the codebase, we've decided to use app.ts as the main entry point for the application since it's already referenced in the webpack configuration. The main.ts file was created during the migration process but is now redundant as its functionality is already covered by app.ts. 

For clarity and to avoid duplication, we recommend:
1. Keep app.ts as the main entry point
2. Consider removing main.ts or refactoring it to serve a different purpose if needed

## Completed Migration Tasks

- [x] Set up TypeScript and webpack configuration
- [x] Convert all JavaScript modules to TypeScript
- [x] Update index.html to reference bundled JavaScript
- [x] Configure GitHub Pages deployment with GitHub Actions
- [x] Successfully build the TypeScript project with webpack
